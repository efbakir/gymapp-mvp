# Unit — Decision Log

- Newest decisions come first.
- Each entry answers three questions: What changed? Why? What follows?
- **Superseded** means the entry is history, not current direction.
- Current product rules also live in `docs/product-compass.md` and `docs/pricing.md`.

<!-- Add new entries below this line. -->

## 2026-08-12 — Use an editorial marketing rhythm and preserve the native core

- **Marketing:** Replace repeated equal-weight feature cards with divided editorial rows, reserve uppercase mono labels for real metadata, and use 16px as the narrative-text floor.
- **Reliability:** Render available local marketing photos immediately and show a fallback only after a real image error; cached images must not remain hidden behind placeholders.
- **Responsive proof:** Stack trust statements cleanly on phones, remove forced-height review cards, and use a consistent audience grid.
- **iOS:** Keep the current active screen architecture. It already follows the shared tokens and reusable components, and a cosmetic rewrite would risk the three-second logging path without a verified usability gain.
- **Documentation:** The responsive website type ramp now lives in `DESIGN.md`; the complete audit and verification record lives in `docs/qa/design-evaluation/system-wide-impeccable-pass-2026-08-12.md`.

## 2026-08-12 — Show subscription timing on the paywall

- **Decision:** Replace the hidden `What happens next?` sheet with an on-page connected timeline that updates with the selected StoreKit tier.
- **Trial sequence:** Show `Day 0`, the cancel-before-renewal window, and the StoreKit-derived renewal day and price. Do not claim Unit sends a reminder until that feature exists.
- **Reminder:** Do not place a reminder toggle on the purchase screen. The visible cancellation window provides the necessary clarity without adding a notification decision before checkout.
- **Tier placement:** Keep plan selection on the same page. A separate pricing step would add friction and separate the selected amount from its renewal explanation.
- **Why:** Every local benchmark with a timeline makes the trial sequence visible before purchase. Unit adopts that clarity while keeping its flat, light, monochrome system and honest copy.
- **Supersedes:** The 2026-07-13 decision to keep `What happens next?` only in a small sheet; the rule to keep price details near the purchase action remains active.

## 2026-08-12 — Align the website and opener with progression

- **Marketing:** Lead with `Know what to lift next`. Explain the product in one sequence: log the work, see the reason, review one next target, then accept or edit it.
- **Control:** Keep one-tap logging and athlete control in the story. Never imply automatic program changes, generated programs, or a black-box coach.
- **Onboarding:** Use a black surface only for the two-second logo opener with `Progressive overload made simple.` The carousel and product remain light.
- **Why:** The verified 2.1 feature, onboarding, App Store listing, and website should make the same promise.

## 2026-08-12 — Match ready-made programs from three honest answers

- **Decision:** Keep two onboarding paths: `I have a program` opens paste import; `I need a program` asks goal, experience, and supported training days, then ranks up to three existing catalog programs.
- **Catalog:** Add one complete 2-day program and one complete 5-day program so the schedule question can offer 2–6 days without a dead answer. Training days are a hard match; goal and experience determine rank.
- **Trust:** Say `Matched to your answers`, never imply Unit generated a new plan. Do not ask about workout duration or equipment until those fields exist across the catalog.
- **Paywall and measurement:** Carry the three controlled answer buckets into the paywall and attach source, goal, experience, and days to trial/purchase events. Never send program names, exercises, weights, reps, or pasted text.
- **Infrastructure:** Keep matching local and deterministic. Supabase remains deferred until the catalog needs remote management or a cross-device user profile.

## 2026-08-12 — Tighten onboarding, screenshot, and ASO copy for 2.1

- **Decision:** Use a concrete progression story across onboarding and the App Store without duplicating the same screen. Onboarding says `Know what to lift next`, explains that Unit prepares the next target after the workout, uses the concrete `10 reps` / `5 lb` example, and keeps one-tap logging as the third value. The six App Store headlines are `Know what to lift next`, `Log a set in 3 seconds`, `Hit 10 reps. Add 5 lb.`, `Paste your plan or choose one`, `See your strength go up`, and `Rest timer on your Lock Screen`.
- **ASO:** Use the 97-byte keyword field `reps,barbell,sets,strength,lifting,weights,routine,history,rest,timer,personal,record,pr,load,1rm`. Keep name/subtitle terms out of the field so Apple can combine the remaining words into searches such as `rest timer`, `personal record`, `PR tracker`, and `1RM tracker`.
- **Why:** The copy is more concrete, scannable, and aligned with Unit's real double-progression behavior. RespectASO scores are directional evidence, not ground truth; keywords support discovery while screenshots explain benefits and conversion value.
- **Next:** Replace the editable 2.1 listing metadata and six screenshots with these canonical assets. This is listing-only work and does not require a new app binary or build number.

## 2026-08-10 — Build 67 replaces build 66

- **Decision:** Version 2.1 moves to build **67**. Build 66 will not be attached in App Store Connect.
- **Why:** No retained archive, upload log, tag, or commit proves what source produced build 66.
- **Next:** Add the private TelemetryDeck ID, inspect the archive, pass automated checks and the physical-device purchase test, then tag the exact commit `v2.1-build67`.
- **Also:** Use the verified Featurebase board at `https://unitlift.featurebase.app`. Workout content stays on-device.

## 2026-08-05 — Disclose paid access before setup

- **Decision:** Show `Paid plan required after setup. Prices and any eligible trial are shown before purchase.` below `Set up your program`.
- **Why:** People should know setup ends at a paywall before spending time building a program.
- **Limits:** This adds no screen, tap, analytics event, StoreKit behavior, or trial promise.
- **Test later:** After launch, test speed-first acquisition by swapping screenshots 1 and 2 only. Keep screenshots 3–6 and all other listing details fixed.

## 2026-08-05 — Add anonymous funnel analytics

- **Decision:** Version 2.1 uses TelemetryDeck for a strict allowlist of anonymous usage events. Analytics are on by default with a Settings opt-out.
- **Why:** Measure onboarding → paywall → purchase → workout → recommendation without adding accounts.
- **Privacy:** Never send exercise names, program text, weights, reps, notes, bodyweight, email, timestamps, raw IDs, or receipts.
- **Limits:** Supabase and CloudKit stay out. Unit still works offline and without analytics.
- **Release note:** This entry advanced the candidate to build 66; the 2026-08-10 entry later replaced it with build 67.

## 2026-08-04 — First-session values are Starting targets

- **Decision:** Saved sets, reps, and weights appear in the first matching workout as a **Starting target**.
- **Prefill order:** Accepted target → latest completed session → saved starting values → empty fields.
- **Why:** Planned data is useful, but it is not workout history.
- **Rule:** Use **Last time** only after a real set was completed. Show `No history yet` only when every prefill source is missing.

## 2026-08-04 — Add a seven-day trial

- **Decision:** Eligible customers get a seven-day free trial on Monthly and Yearly. Weekly and Lifetime have no trial.
- **Default:** Eligible new customers start on Monthly. Ineligible customers start on Weekly.
- **Why:** Let new customers test the full product without adding a permanent free tier.
- **Rule:** Show trial copy only when StoreKit returns a valid free offer and Apple confirms eligibility.
- **Next:** Configure the same offers in App Store Connect and verify them in Apple’s sandbox purchase sheet.
- **Supersedes:** The no-trial rule and the rule that Weekly is always selected by default.

## 2026-08-04 — Progression positioning ships in 2.1

- **Decision:** Ship transparent double progression in version 2.1, not 2.2.
- **App Store:** Name `Unit: Progressive Overload`; subtitle `Gym Workout Log & Tracker`. Home Screen name stays `Unit`.
- **Why:** The feature is verified, so the listing and the product can test the same promise together.
- **Next:** Replace the old screenshots with the progression-led English set. Do not publish stale localized metadata.

## 2026-08-03 — Unit becomes progression-guided

- **Decision:** Unit is a transparent progression-guided logger, not only a passive log.
- **Feature:** One opt-in double-progression rule suggests the smallest next-session change after the workout.
- **Control:** The user edits or accepts the suggestion. Nothing changes automatically.
- **Limits:** Keep the three-second Gym Test. Do not restore cycles, failure counters, deloads, recovery logic, or automatic program rewrites.

## 2026-07-27 — Build 59 replaces build 58

- **Status:** Superseded by later release builds.
- **Decision:** Use version 2.1 build 59 from tag `v2.1-build59`; do not submit build 58.
- **Why:** Build 58 could restore the paywall after a successful purchase because of a stale entitlement refresh.
- **Next:** Repeat the physical-device purchase test and archive only a clean, tagged `main` commit.

## 2026-07-23 — Add review and feedback prompts

- **Decision:** Ask for an App Store review after workout 1 and show one feedback card after workout 3.
- **Rule:** Count only new workout session IDs for this version. Never interrupt active logging.
- **Feedback:** Open the Unit feedback calendar or a prefilled email to `support@unitlift.app`.
- **Release note:** This entry set 2.1 build 58; later build decisions supersede that number.

## 2026-07-22 — Bind releases to clean main

- **Decision:** Recover the July 13–17 work, remove Debug-only forced onboarding, and make Debug and Release use the same saved state.
- **Why:** Version 2.0 build 35 was uploaded from older committed source while Xcode showed newer uncommitted work.
- **Rule:** Archive only from clean, tagged `main`. Record the tag and build number before upload.
- **Release note:** This entry set 2.1 build 36; later build decisions supersede that number.

## 2026-07-17 — Remove the simulated onboarding set

- **Decision:** Remove the `Try a set` card from program review. Do not move it elsewhere.
- **Why:** Review should confirm exercises, sets, reps, and weights. A fake set added confusion and looked like history.
- **Effect:** Program review now leads with the workout cards and one completion action.

## 2026-07-13 — Zero weight means bodyweight

- **Decision:** Entering `0` completes the set and classifies the exercise as bodyweight.
- **Display:** Show `BW`, never `0 kg`, across active workout, Today, History, and progress chips.
- **Rule:** Empty weight is still invalid for an unclassified weighted exercise.

## 2026-07-13 — Use the compact yearly savings badge

- **Decision:** The yearly badge says `Save N%`, not `Save N% vs weekly`.
- **Why:** The longer badge overpowered the plan card. The supporting price line already explains the comparison.
- **Effect:** Pricing math and purchase behavior do not change.

## 2026-07-13 — Keep price details near the purchase action

- **Decision:** Repeat the selected StoreKit price and renewal type in the sticky purchase area.
- **Why:** The amount must stay visible when the selected plan card scrolls away.
- **Also:** Keep `What happens next?` as a small sheet, not another page.
- **Source:** Uses RevenueCat’s repeatable clarity ideas, not its unproven success-story patterns.

## 2026-07-13 — Simplify the paywall hierarchy

- **Decision:** Use one flow: Unit proof → saved program → plan choice → sticky purchase button.
- **Removed:** Next-exercise teaser and repeated feature claims.
- **Why:** The old page mixed too many messages and made the plan cards feel disconnected.
- **Keep:** StoreKit pricing, savings math, Restore, Terms, Privacy, and purchase behavior.

## 2026-07-13 — Finalize four localized app names

- **Decision:** Use de `Unit: Trainingstagebuch`, es-MX `Unit: Registro de gym`, fr `Unit: Carnet de Muscu`, and tr `Unit: Antrenman Günlüğü`.
- **Open:** pt-BR `Unit: Diário de Treino` still needs a native review.
- **Rule:** Nothing goes to App Store Connect without the locale-specific founder approval.

## 2026-07-13 — Tighten in-app copy

- **Decision:** Remove warm-up coaching, shorten onboarding labels, simplify Today states, and centralize stable copy in `AppCopy`.
- **Why:** The app was explaining too much. Unit records training; it does not teach exercises.
- **Voice rule:** First-person singular prevents fake corporate `we`; it does not require `I` or `my` in every label.
- **Effect:** This supersedes the 2026-07-11 `Summary` / `Save my program` wording.

## 2026-07-13 — Allow honest conversion tactics on the paywall

- **Decision:** Use live savings, per-week equivalents, and the user’s program name to clarify the choice.
- **Rule:** Every number comes from StoreKit. No fake comparison price, countdown, scarcity, or unsupported trial claim.
- **Placement:** Badge the upsell tier, not the default tier.
- **Why:** Make the value ladder clear without breaking trust.

## 2026-07-11 — Replace style keywords with behavior keywords

- **Decision:** Target behaviors such as rest timer, set/reps counter, weights history, progressive overload, and training notes.
- **Removed:** Narrow style terms such as powerlifting, barbell, 5x5, hypertrophy, and squat.
- **Why:** Unit sells simple tracking behavior, not one training style.

## 2026-07-11 — Renumber release build 16 to 35

- **Status:** Historical release decision.
- **Decision:** Use version 2.0 build 35 because App Store Connect already had builds 24–34.
- **Why:** Those builds predated the launch-hang fix. Build 35 was the first clear post-fix candidate.

## 2026-07-11 — Add `simple` to keywords

- **Decision:** Remove redundant `rep` and generic `notes`; add `simple`.
- **Why:** `Simple workout tracker` matches Unit’s strongest user feedback and positioning.
- **Supersedes:** The same-day `planner` → `simple` edit against the older keyword list.

## 2026-07-11 — Freeze English App Store copy

- **Status:** Later progression-led listing decisions supersede parts of this freeze.
- **Decision:** Freeze `docs/app-store-copy.md` after changing `Paste any program` to `Paste your program` and removing an overclaim from What’s New.
- **Why:** App Store Connect still had stale v1 text and the localization work needed one stable source.
- **Release note:** The build-16 plan was later changed to build 35.

## 2026-07-11 — Use a colon in the App Store name

- **Decision:** Use `Unit: Gym Workout Log`, not the em-dash version.
- **Why:** The colon scans better and matches the App Store category pattern.
- **Status:** The words were later replaced by the progression-led name; the separator rule still applies.

## 2026-07-11 — Consolidate App Store copy

- **Decision:** `docs/app-store-copy.md` is the only source for App Store Connect text.
- **Why:** Three files had conflicting subtitles, promos, descriptions, and What’s New copy.
- **Rule:** Other docs point to the canonical file instead of copying its strings.

## 2026-07-11 — Launch metadata in five languages

- **Decision:** Localize metadata in German, Spanish (Mexico), Portuguese (Brazil), French, and Turkish.
- **Keep English:** Screenshots and in-app UI.
- **Pricing:** Let Apple convert the USD price ladder. Do not add custom storefront prices.
- **Deferred:** Japanese and Korean need paid native translation. Simplified Chinese waits for an ICP decision.

## 2026-07-11 — Rename the App Store listing

- **Status:** Superseded by `Unit: Progressive Overload` on 2026-08-04.
- **Decision:** Change the listing from `Unit — Gym Notebook` to `Unit — Gym Workout Log`; keep the Home Screen name `Unit`.
- **Why:** `Workout` and `log` had stronger search value.

## 2026-07-11 — Revise program preview

- **Status:** Superseded by the minimal-language pass on 2026-07-13.
- **Decision:** Use `Summary`, `Save my program`, and row-tap editing. Remove the separate pencil button.
- **Also:** Track defaulted sets/reps directly so an explicit `3×8` does not trigger a false warning.

## 2026-07-02 — Lower Weekly to $2.99

- **Decision:** Price Weekly at **$2.99**. Keep Monthly $4.99, Yearly $29.99, and optional Lifetime $44.99.
- **Why:** Weekly and Monthly at the same $4.99 price made the default look broken or manipulative.
- **Rule:** Every tier must have a clear role; no visible tier may strictly dominate another.
- **Next:** Change App Store Connect before submission. App prices remain StoreKit-derived.

## 2026-06-29 — Set the v2 price structure

- **Status:** Weekly price was changed to $2.99 on 2026-07-02. The other rules remain.
- **Decision:** Show Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly; show Lifetime only when StoreKit returns it. Select Weekly by default for customers without a trial.
- **Rule:** Never show fake fallback prices. Update `docs/pricing.md`, App Store Connect, then code.

## 2026-06-29 — Keep widget typography separate for v1

- **Decision:** Do not move widget typography into app `AppFont` tokens yet.
- **Why:** The widget target needs a proper shared token package, not a temporary bridge.
- **Next:** Revisit only when the app and widget share a real design-system package.

## 2026-06-18 — Simplify starter-program onboarding

- **Decision:** Show five clear programs: Full Body, Upper / Lower, 5/3/1, Power + Size, and Push Pull Legs.
- **Reuse:** Make onboarding use the same Level / Goal / Days filters and list components as the in-app library.
- **Remove:** Delete the 1RM input screen. Library users enter weights in program preview.
- **Why:** Insider program names and a true-1RM question were hard for most people to understand.
- **Effect:** Library onboarding drops from five steps to four. The unused 1RM calculation code stays available for later.

## 2026-06-18 — Remove the pre-onboarding price screen

- **Status:** The 2026-08-05 inline paid-access disclosure is the current solution.
- **Decision:** Delete the separate price-disclosure splash and return to one hard paywall after onboarding.
- **Why:** A price screen before setup hurt the first-run experience.
- **Accepted risk:** The App Store purchase label alone may not make a fully gated app obvious.

## 2026-06-17 — Lock onboarding, pricing tests, and paid-growth rules

- **Onboarding:** Use paste-first entry plus five starter programs. Remove the manual builder from first run.
- **Pricing test:** Measure conversion before raising Yearly. Use a clear rollback threshold.
- **Paid growth:** Do not scale ads until measured CAC is below LTV with payback under six months. A test up to $100 is allowed.
- **Target:** $11k MRR / $132k ARR is the practical milestone; the earlier $1M ARR framing is long-term.
- **Note:** The D0 price splash from this entry was removed the next day.

## 2026-06-16 — Move to a hard paywall

- **Decision:** Gate the full app after free onboarding. The paywall cannot be dismissed.
- **Users:** Existing v1 users are not grandfathered; the old `InstallProvenance` promise was removed.
- **Why:** The founder chose immediate revenue over the untested soft-paywall plan and accepted review and retention risk.
- **Supersedes:** The 2026-05-14 hybrid model and 2026-05-31 free-core model.
- **Note:** Later entries restored optional Lifetime, lowered prices, and added eligible trials.

## 2026-06-11 — Refine the Reddit plan

- **Decision:** Post feedback requests now in link-friendly communities while building karma for gated communities.
- **r/iosapps gate:** 25 community karma, verified email, ABC format, correct flair, and one promo per 30 days.
- **Rule:** Manual posting only. No comment automation.
- **Why:** Live rules showed the old blanket `link only in first comment` guidance was too broad.

## 2026-06-11 — Use identity-led training content

- **Decision:** Lead reels with training identity footage and one strong on-screen claim. Mention Unit in the caption and comment funnel.
- **Do not lead with:** Full app demos. A short app glimpse is optional.
- **Why:** The reference creator’s best posts showed no app and were easier to produce.
- **Risk:** Generic gym motivation may get views but few installs. Claims must point to tracking and simplicity.

## 2026-06-11 — Reduce marketing to one routine

- **Decision:** Cut active marketing docs from 56 files to 6 and archive the rest.
- **Daily:** One TikTok/Instagram reel, reply to comments, and write 1–3 Reddit karma comments.
- **Weekly:** Film a small clip library on Sunday.
- **Why:** One fixed routine is easier to execute than many channel plans.

## 2026-06-11 — Separate durable and tactical anti-patterns

- **Decision:** Mark legal, brand, and budget rules as durable. Treat algorithm and reach claims as testable.
- **Change:** Allow plain keyword-to-DM funnels; keep hollow engagement bait banned.
- **Why:** Live account data contradicted the compressed rule that banned both.

## 2026-06-11 — Increase posting volume

- **Status:** Later simplified to the one-daily-post routine.
- **Decision:** Target 1–4 posts per day across accounts with different identities. Never clone the same content across accounts.
- **Why:** The app was live, so more time could move from building to marketing.

## 2026-06-11 — Study proven Instagram accounts

- **Decision:** Create account studies that copy hooks, cadence, and formats, never a creator’s content, face, or captions.
- **Why:** Current winning accounts are more useful than invented content theory.
- **Open at the time:** Carousels, trial reels, editing workflow, posting volume, and account identity.

## 2026-06-11 — Add PR badges to History

- **Decision:** Show PR tags in session rows, the session summary, and set details.
- **Logic:** Calculate PRs from completed non-warm-up sets in completed sessions. Weight ranks first; reps break ties. The first log is not a PR.
- **Why:** This makes the `Every PR` screenshot claim true.
- **Rule:** Keep History and active-workout PR calculations aligned.

## 2026-06-11 — Switch the marketing site to launched state

- **Decision:** Make the live App Store URL the default and use git as the launch-state source.
- **Added:** Official App Store badge, approved screenshot crops, desktop QR code, Smart App Banner, `Download` CTA, and launch date.
- **Why:** Production should not depend on an unset Vercel environment variable.

## 2026-06-09 — Rename Ghost values to Last time

- **Decision:** Use **Last time** in the app and plain descriptions in marketing. Do not invent another feature name.
- **Why:** Users say `last time` or `previous`; nobody naturally says `ghost values`.
- **Keep internal:** `metricIsGhost` and the unrelated `AppGhostButton` names.
- **Marketing angle:** The user’s own history, not an AI recommendation.

## 2026-06-09 — Keep pasted weights for the first workout

- **Status:** Refined by the 2026-08-04 **Starting target** decision.
- **Decision:** Carry weights from a pasted program into the first workout instead of discarding them.
- **Why:** Losing data the user already entered broke trust.
- **Rule:** Percentages such as `@80%` stay blank until Unit can resolve them.

## 2026-06-03 — Remove Pro signals from v1.0

- **Decision:** Hide subscription controls and Export Pro UI; replace the Pro chip in screenshot 5.
- **Why:** Apple rejected build 12 because the app showed paid-feature signals but had no IAPs configured.
- **Next:** Upload build 13 or later with no purchase surface. Update screenshot 5 before resubmission.
- **Later:** The v2 hard-paywall decision superseded this free-launch setup.

## 2026-05-31 — Choose free core plus soft Pro

- **Status:** Superseded by the hard paywall on 2026-06-16.
- **Decision:** Keep core logging free and gate only export, Health, cloud, and Watch features. No weekly tier or onboarding paywall.
- **Also:** Grandfather pre-paywall installs through `InstallProvenance`.
- **Why:** The plan aimed to protect trust while monetizing off-path features.

## 2026-05-31 — Defer Pro to v1.1

- **Status:** Superseded by later monetization decisions.
- **Decision:** Ship v1.0 with no IAPs and hide every paywall entry point.
- **Why:** No real Pro feature was ready, so taking money risked App Review rejection.
- **Next at the time:** Re-enable Pro only after at least one paid feature existed.

## 2026-05-30 — Configure Pro for v1.0 review

- **Status:** Superseded the next day by the v1.1 deferral.
- **Decision:** Submit three IAPs with v1.0 instead of stripping Pro copy.
- **Risk:** The advertised Pro features were not built, so App Review could reject the purchase as incomplete.

## 2026-05-14 — Add a hybrid Pro upsell

- **Status:** Superseded by the hard paywall on 2026-06-16.
- **Decision:** Keep logging free and add quiet Pro entry points in Settings and History.
- **Planned Pro:** Export, Health, themes, analytics, Watch, and later cloud sync.
- **Why:** Test real conversion before gating core logging.

## 2026-05-12 — Change the bundle ID

- **Decision:** Use `app.unitlift` and `app.unitlift.UnitWidgetExtension`.
- **Why:** `com.unitlift.app` was unavailable and `app.unitlift` matches the owned `unitlift.app` domain.
- **Effect:** App Store Connect and provisioning must use the new IDs.

## 2026-05-10 — Redesign screenshot 5

- **Decision:** Replace the Settings screenshot with a simple three-row trust graphic: Storage, Account, and Export.
- **Why:** A literal Settings screen looked like settings, not a clear privacy message.
- **Later:** The 2026-06-03 App Review fix replaced the Export Pro row.

## 2026-05-10 — Add a Data section to Settings

- **Decision:** Add Storage, Account, and Export rows above Preferences.
- **Why:** Give data ownership a real product surface and a source for screenshot 5.
- **Later:** The 2026-06-03 decision hid Export Pro for the free v1.0 build.

## 2026-05-10 — Remove the History calendar

- **Decision:** History becomes one chronological list grouped by month.
- **Why:** Most days have one workout, so the calendar added taps and a large parallel UI implementation.
- **Future:** If date navigation becomes useful, add a filter instead of restoring the calendar.

## 2026-05-10 — Set iOS 18 as the deployment target

- **Decision:** Lower the app and widget deployment target from iOS 26 to iOS 18 and add availability fallbacks.
- **Why:** iOS 26 excluded too many devices for launch.
- **Bundle note:** This entry’s `com.unitlift.app` ID was replaced by `app.unitlift` on 2026-05-12.

## 2026-05-01 — Use continuous iOS corners everywhere

- **Decision:** Use iOS continuous corners for every rounded container. Use the web squircle equivalent where supported.
- **Why:** The app already mostly followed this shape; enforcement closed the remaining drift.
- **Rule:** Do not add a custom Squircle component.

## 2026-05-01 — Use first-person singular voice

- **Decision:** User-facing copy uses `I / me / my` or names Unit as the actor. Never use corporate `we / us / our`.
- **Why:** Unit is built by one person, Efe Bakir.
- **Rule:** Check this across app copy, App Store text, marketing, legal, support, and social posts.

## 2026-05-01 — Add the docs index

- **Decision:** Use `docs/INDEX.md` as the on-demand catalog and archive four stale docs.
- **Why:** Many useful docs were invisible to fresh sessions, while adding all of them to `CLAUDE.md` would add noise.
- **Rule:** Add new docs to the index, not the session-level guide.

## 2026-05-01 — Start the decision log

- **Decision:** Keep cross-session product, scope, design, and release decisions in this file.
- **Why:** Current-state docs explain what is true now; this log explains what changed and why.
- **Rule:** Keep entries short, dated, and newest-first. Mark replaced decisions as **Superseded**.
