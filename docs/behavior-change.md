# Unit — Behavior Change Summary

Short summary of concepts from **Designing for Behavior Change** (Stephen Wendel et al.) relevant to habit formation and workout logging. Full text: [docs/references/Designing for Behavior Change.pdf](references/Designing%20for%20Behavior%20Change.pdf).

---

## 1. Behavior as outcome

- **Idea**: Behavior = what the user does (e.g. “log a set,” “complete a session”). Design for the behavior, not just the product.
- **Unit**: Target behaviors: (1) Start a workout from a template. (2) Log each set in under 3 seconds (Gym Test). (3) Use rest timer. We optimize the product so these behaviors are easy and rewarding.

## 2. Motivation, ability, and prompts (MAP / Fogg)

- **Idea**: Behavior happens when **motivation** and **ability** are sufficient, and a **prompt** (trigger) occurs. Increase ability (make it easy) and align prompts with context.
- **Unit**: Motivation = “I want to track my program” and “I’m someone who logs” (identity). Ability = high (defaults, one-tap, no required RPE). Prompts = “Start workout” on open, “Next set” after rest, “Complete set” on each row. We don’t rely on raising motivation; we lower the bar (ability) and make prompts obvious.

## 3. Identity-based habits

- **Idea**: Lasting change is easier when the user adopts an identity (“I’m a logger”) rather than only chasing outcomes (“I want to get stronger”). Design reinforces identity through small wins and consistency.
- **Unit**: Completing a set and a session are small wins. “You logged 4 sets” and “Session complete” reinforce “I log my workouts.” No heavy gamification—just clear, consistent logging so identity (“I’m someone who tracks”) is reinforced. See [mental-models.md](mental-models.md) (Identity Change).

## 4. Reducing friction and cognitive load

- **Idea**: Friction (steps, fields, decisions) reduces the likelihood of the behavior. Under physical stress (post-set), cognitive load is high—minimize it.
- **Unit**: Gym Test is the design constraint. Defaults (last weight/reps/RPE), one primary CTA (“Complete set”), optional RPE, rest timer on Lock Screen. No multi-step set entry. Every tap should have a clear purpose.

---

## 5. Feedback and reinforcement

- **Idea**: Immediate, clear feedback reinforces the behavior and confirms success.
- **Unit**: After “Complete set,” show clear success (e.g. checkmark, row marked done). Session end: “Workout complete.” History shows past sessions so progress is visible. Feedback is immediate and unambiguous.

---

## 6. What we avoid

- **Guilt or shame**: No “you missed a day” nagging. We might show “last logged: 2 days ago” without blame.
- **Over-promising**: We don’t promise transformation; we promise a fast, reliable log for your program.
- **Required reflection**: We don’t force journaling or long forms.

## Summary

| Concept | Unit takeaway |
|--------|---------------------|
| Behavior as outcome | Design for: start workout, log set (&lt;3 s), use rest. |
| Motivation, ability, prompt | Maximize ability (defaults, one-tap); clear prompts (CTAs). |
| Identity | Reinforce “I log” through set/session completion and history. |
| Friction / cognitive load | Gym Test; minimize steps and decisions. |
| Feedback | Immediate success state; session complete; history. |
