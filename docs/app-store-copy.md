# Unit — App Store copy (canonical)

> **FROZEN 2026-08-04 FOR VERSION 2.1 — founder-approved direction.** The single source of truth for every App Store Connect text field; if a string isn't here, it isn't canon. The five locale files predate the progressive-overload rename and must not be published without regeneration and review.
> Process (what to click, in what order): `docs/app-store-submission/final-submit-checklist.md`.
> Localized metadata derives from this file — see `docs/app-store-localization/README.md`.
> The progressive-overload positioning ships with the verified transparent double-progression feature in 2.1. Retired copy lives in git history, not beside the active fields.

## App name (30)

```
Unit: Progressive Overload
```

26 characters. The App Store listing names the outcome Unit now supports. The in-app and Home Screen name stays `Unit` (`INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName`). Unit provides transparent, user-controlled double-progression suggestions; it does not claim to calculate an optimal program.

## Subtitle (30)

```
Gym Workout Log & Tracker
```

25 characters. The subtitle explains the product category while the name carries the progression outcome.

## Promotional text (170, editable anytime without review)

```
Log each set in one tap. Unit remembers last time, then suggests one clear next target after your workout. Accept it, repeat it, or change it.
```

Evergreen and explicit about the mechanism. It promises a suggestion, not coaching or automatic program control.

## Description (4000)

```
Log a set in 3 seconds and know what to aim for next time.

Choose a ready-made program or paste your own. Unit keeps your previous weights and reps ready, so each set is quick to confirm or adjust.

For exercises with a rep range, Unit can suggest one clear target after your workout. Reach the top of the range on every set to add weight. Otherwise, keep the weight and build reps. Every suggestion can be accepted, repeated, or edited.

• One-tap set logging
• Transparent progressive overload targets
• Ready-made programs
• Paste your routine
• Automatic rest timer on the Lock Screen
• Workout history and personal records

No account. No ads. No social feed. Raw workout details stay on your iPhone. Unit sends limited anonymous product-usage events to help improve the app. Analytics are not linked to your identity, are not used for tracking, and can be disabled in Settings.

Unit requires a paid purchase after setup. Weekly, monthly, and yearly auto-renewing subscriptions are available. Eligible new customers may receive a 7-day free introductory trial on Monthly or Yearly when Apple confirms the offer. Weekly and optional Lifetime have no trial. Prices and offer details are shown in the app before purchase.

Terms of Use (EULA): https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/
Privacy Policy: https://unitlift.app/privacy
```

Short on purpose: iOS descriptions are conversion-only (not search-indexed) and only ~3 lines show before "more". The paid-purchase paragraph + both legal URLs are Guideline 3.1.2(b) compliance — **never trim them**.

## Keywords (100, comma-separated, no spaces)

```
reps,barbell,sets,strength,lifting,weights,routine,history,rest,timer,personal,record,pr,load,1rm
```

97 bytes. Behavior and category terms are deduplicated against `Progressive Overload`, `Gym`, `Workout`, `Log`, and `Tracker` in the name and subtitle. The field supports combinations including reps tracker, barbell tracker, set tracker, rest timer, personal record, PR tracker, load tracker, and 1RM tracker.

## What's New — v2.1

```
Unit 2.1 adds transparent progressive overload without slowing down your workout.

• See one clear next target after each completed workout
• Increase reps, then weight, using your own rep range and increment
• Accept, repeat, or edit every suggestion
• Improved logging, history, feedback, and purchase reliability
```

## Screenshots

The old screenshot set does not support the new App Store name. Capture and upload a new English set before submission, in this order:

1. `Know what to lift next` — real post-workout recommendation with previous target, next target, reason, and action.
2. `Log a set in 3 seconds` — active workout with accepted target and Last time.
3. `Hit 10 reps. Add 5 lb.` — real accepted double-progression result with previous and next targets.
4. `Paste your plan or choose one` — beginner-inclusive setup paths.
5. `See your strength go up` — exercise progress and history.
6. `Rest timer on your Lock Screen` — verified Live Activity.

Screenshots must use production data and names, not the Progression QA harness.

## Reviewer notes (App Review Information → Notes)

```
Unit 2.1 is a local-first gym logger with optional transparent double progression. It requires a paid purchase to access workout-logging features. Onboarding runs free — the reviewer can complete the opener, value carousel, and full program setup without paying. After setup is saved, the paywall appears full-screen and cannot be dismissed.

To evaluate:
1. Open the app. Onboarding starts with a standalone opener, then a three-slide value carousel with the "Set up your program" CTA, then program setup. No personal information is requested.
2. After onboarding completes, the paywall appears with these StoreKit products: Weekly com.unit.weekly $2.99/week, Monthly com.unit.monthly $4.99/month, Yearly com.unit.annual $29.99/year, and Lifetime com.unit.lifetime $44.99 one-time only if that non-consumable is configured and returned by StoreKit. An eligible new customer defaults to Monthly; an ineligible customer defaults to Weekly. There is no "Not now" affordance; the only ways out are to purchase through StoreKit sandbox or close the app.
3. When StoreKit returns a valid Free introductory offer and reports the sandbox customer eligible, Monthly and Yearly show a 7-day free trial. Weekly and Lifetime never show a trial. Start a trial, subscribe to another recurring tier, or buy Lifetime if visible. A verified purchase dismisses the paywall and unlocks Today. Log a set; the rest timer starts automatically and appears on the Lock Screen / Dynamic Island.
4. To verify cancellation flow for subscriptions: Settings (visible only when entitled) → Manage Subscription → cancel. Lifetime entitlement has no Manage Subscription row because it is a one-time purchase.

Progressive overload in 2.1 is optional and configured per routine and exercise. It evaluates completed straight working sets at one consistent load after the workout. A recommendation shows the complete next target and its reason. The user must explicitly use, repeat, or edit the target; Unit never rewrites the routine automatically and never interrupts active set logging. Mixed working-set loads, incomplete configured sets, invalid increments, and unsupported bodyweight sessions produce an explanation instead of an invented target.

Engagement prompts in version 2.1 count only workouts completed after installing this version:
- After the first new completed workout, close its workout summary. Two seconds after Today is active, Unit makes one standard StoreKit review-request attempt. iOS may suppress the visible prompt.
- On the third new completed workout’s summary, Unit shows a one-time “Help improve Unit” card. “Book a 15-minute call” opens https://calendar.notion.so/meet/efbakir/unit-feedback and “Email feedback” opens a prefilled email to support@unitlift.app.
- Neither prompt appears during an active workout. Both attempt/shown states persist locally and do not repeat.

Trial text is conditional: the selected product must be an auto-renewable subscription with a valid StoreKit Free introductory offer, and Apple must report the customer eligible. Eligibility alone does not produce a trial claim. The selected billed amount remains visible directly above the CTA; trial duration, post-trial price, auto-renewal, and cancel-via-App-Store copy appear on the paywall. Ineligible customers receive the standard subscription disclosure with no trial text.

Raw workout details remain on-device via SwiftData. Unit sends a small allowlist of anonymous product-interaction and purchase-state events through TelemetryDeck. TelemetryDeck processes a privacy-preserving app-scoped identifier so anonymous activity can be counted. Analytics are not linked to identity, are not used for tracking, and can be disabled immediately in Settings → Anonymous analytics. Unit remains fully functional offline and when analytics configuration is unavailable.

## What's New history

**v1.1 — prepared, never shipped** (ASC shows 1.0 as the only released version; verified live 2026-07-11): PR badges in History; paste import reads table-style + Turkish programs; onboarding day-count 1–7, keyboard fix, force-quit crash fix; stray Done button removed; Start workout only on Today. Fold anything still relevant into the v2.0 notes if wanted.
**v1.0 (live):** "Unit is here. Log your sets in one tap, import your program from Notes, and track your progress — all without leaving the gym floor."

## Voice rules (apply to every field above)

First-person singular only (`I / me / my`) — never `we / us / our` (PRODUCT.md §Brand Personality). Trial language is allowed only when it accurately reflects verified StoreKit offer metadata and customer eligibility; no countdown, fake discount, or urgency language. Progression claims may describe only the shipped, transparent double-progression behavior and must not imply AI coaching, program generation, recovery adaptation, or automatic control.
