# Swift Style - Types (Struct, Class, Enum)

This skill covers the differences between Swift structs, classes, and enums, and when to use each.

## Key Concepts

### Value vs Reference Types

| Aspect | Struct (Value) | Class (Reference) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Copying | Creates independent copy | Copies reference (shared instance) |
| Identity | No identity (compared by value) | Has identity (compared by reference) |
| Storage | Inline | Heap allocated |
| Inheritance | No inheritance | Single inheritance |
| ARC | Not needed | Reference counted |
| Thread-safety | Safer (copies are independent) | Requires synchronization |

### When to Use Each

**Use Structs when:**
- Representing data without identity
- Modeling simple data containers
- Thread safety is important
- Default choice for most types

**Use Classes when:**
- Need reference semantics/identity
- Requires inheritance
- Interoperating with Objective-C
- Managing shared mutable state

**Use Enums when:**
- Modeling a finite set of states
- Need exhaustive pattern matching
- Representing mutually exclusive options
- Building state machines

## Code Examples

### Struct (Value Type)

```swift
struct Point {
    var x: Double
    var y: Double
}

var p1 = Point(x: 0, y: 0)
var p2 = p1               // p2 is a COPY of p1
p2.x = 5                  // Mutating p2 does NOT affect p1

print(p1.x, p2.x) // 0 5
```

### Class (Reference Type)

```swift
class Person {
    var name: String
    weak var friend: Person?   // Weak reference to avoid cycles
    
    init(name: String) { self.name = name }
}

let alice = Person(name: "Alice")
let bob = alice           // bob refers to the SAME instance
bob.name = "Bob"          // Mutates the shared instance

print(alice.name) // "Bob"
```

### Enum with Associated Values

```swift
enum NetworkResult {
    case success(Data)
    case failure(Error)
    case notConnected
}

func handle(_ result: NetworkResult) {
    switch result {
    case .success(let data):
        print("Got \(data.count) bytes")
    case .failure(let err):
        print("Error: \(err)")
    case .notConnected:
        print("No internet")
    }
}
```

### Enum with Raw Values

```swift
enum Direction: String {
    case north = "N"
    case south = "S"
    case east = "E"
    case west = "W"
}

let dir = Direction.north
print(dir.rawValue)  // "N"
```

### Mutability with Let/Var

```swift
// Struct in let constant - cannot mutate
let immutablePoint = Point(x: 1, y: 2)
// immutablePoint.x = 10   // ERROR

// Class in let constant - CAN mutate properties
let person = Person(name: "Alice")
person.name = "Bob"       // OK - reference is constant, not instance
```

## SwiftData @Model Exception

SwiftData `@Model` types **must be classes**, not structs. This is the one case where the "default to struct" rule does not apply:

```swift
// ✅ Correct — @Model requires class
@Model
class WorkoutSession {
    var date: Date = Date()
    var cycleId: UUID?
    var weekNumber: Int = 0
}

// ❌ Wrong — @Model cannot be applied to struct
@Model
struct WorkoutSession { }  // Compiler error
```

`@Observable` view models are also classes, but they don't require class — the macro just happens to work on classes only in current Swift releases.

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Default to structs** - Use simplest type that expresses intent
2. **Exception: @Model must be a class** - SwiftData requires reference type
3. **Use classes only when needed** - Identity, inheritance, Obj-C interop, or framework requirement
4. **Use enums for state machines** - Exhaustive checking prevents bugs
5. **Mark classes `final` when not subclassing** - Enables optimizations
6. **Prefer protocols over inheritance** - More flexible composition
7. **Keep structs small** - Cheap to copy, easier to reason about
8. **Leverage exhaustive switch** - Compiler enforces all cases handled

## Decision Flowchart

```
Need identity or reference semantics?
├── YES → Use Class
└── NO → Need inheritance?
    ├── YES → Use Class
    └── NO → Modeling finite states?
        ├── YES → Use Enum
        └── NO → Use Struct (default)
```

## Performance Considerations

| Aspect | Struct | Class |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Memory layout | Inline | Heap + pointer |
| Copy cost | Size-dependent | Cheap (pointer) |
| ARC overhead | None | Retain/release |
| Thread safety | Copy gives snapshot | Requires locks/actors |

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Unintentional sharing with classes | Use structs for value semantics |
| Mutable structs inside let | Change to var or use class |
| Missing enum cases in switch | Compiler will warn, handle all cases |
| Not marking final classes | Add final when not subclassing |
