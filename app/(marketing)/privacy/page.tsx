          <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Unit is designed with privacy as a default. Your raw workout data
            stays on your device and Unit does not require an account. Unit sends
            limited anonymous product-usage events to help me understand where
            setup or workout flows fail. You can disable analytics in Settings.
          </p>

          <h2 id="analytics">Anonymous Analytics</h2>
          <p>
            Unit uses TelemetryDeck for limited product analytics. Analytics are
            enabled by default and can be disabled at any time under Settings
            → Anonymous analytics. Disabling the toggle stops future analytics
            events immediately. Unit remains fully functional offline and when
            analytics are disabled or unavailable.
          </p>
          <p>
            TelemetryDeck processes these events for Unit under its privacy
            safeguards. You can read the TelemetryDeck privacy FAQ at{" "}
            <a
              href="https://telemetrydeck.com/docs/guides/privacy-faq/"
              rel="noreferrer"
              target="_blank"
            >
              telemetrydeck.com
            </a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Events describe product interactions using controlled categories
            and broad buckets, such as which onboarding slide was viewed,
            whether a program was pasted or selected, whether a trial or
            purchase completed, a broad workout-duration or set-count range,
            and whether a progression suggestion was accepted, repeated, or
            edited. These events are not linked to your identity and are not
            used for advertising or tracking across apps or websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Analytics never include exercise names, program text, weights,
            repetitions, notes, bodyweight, email addresses, exact workout
            timestamps, raw workout identifiers, calendar details, or StoreKit
            receipts.
          </p>

          <h2 id="data-storage">Data Storage</h2>
          <p>
            All data you create in Unit, including exercises, workout sessions,
            cycles, progression rules, and set entries, is stored locally on your
            device using Apple&apos;s SwiftData framework. This data is not
            transmitted to any external server.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your device, Unit&apos;s local
            data may be included in those backups. iCloud Backup is operated by
            Apple under your Apple ID and is governed by Apple&apos;s privacy
            policy. I have no access to your iCloud account or its contents.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you delete the App, your locally stored data will be removed from
            your device.
          </p>

          <h2 id="data-not-collected">Data I Do Not Collect</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>I do not collect your name, email address, or contact information through the App</li>
            <li>I do not collect workout data or training history</li>
            <li>I do not use advertising identifiers, fingerprinting, or session replay</li>
            <li>I do not use advertising SDKs</li>
            <li>I do not use analytics for cross-app or cross-website tracking</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="feature-requests">Feature Requests</h2>
          <p>
            Settings includes an optional &quot;Request a feature&quot; link. It
            opens a public feedback portal operated by Featurebase (CORDNET OÜ).
            Unit does not send workout data, health data, device information,
            your identity, or analytics parameters when opening this link.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anything you choose to submit or upvote on the portal is handled by
            Featurebase and may be publicly visible. Do not include personal or
            workout information in a request. Featurebase may process technical
            information such as your IP address, browser details, and cookies
            under its{" "}

          </p>

          <h2 id="purchases">Purchases</h2>
          <p>
            Unit offers in-app purchases processed by Apple through the App
            Store. I do not receive or store your payment information or
            StoreKit receipt. Unit may send an anonymous event containing only
            the selected subscription tier and whether a verified trial or
            purchase completed. Purchase records are managed by your Apple ID.
          </p>

          <h2 id="healthkit">HealthKit</h2>
          <p>
            Unit does not currently integrate with Apple HealthKit. If HealthKit
            integration is added in a future update, this policy will be updated
            and you will be asked for explicit permission before any health data
            is accessed.
          </p>

          <h2 id="cookies">Cookies and Web Tracking</h2>
          <p>
            This website does not use cookies, analytics scripts, or any form of
            visitor tracking.
          </p>

          <h2 id="children">Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Unit is not directed at children under the age of 13. I do not
            knowingly collect information from children.
          </p>

          <h2 id="rights">Your Rights</h2>
          <p>
            Unit does not maintain an account or server-side workout record for
            me to delete, export, or modify. Your workout data remains under
            your control on your device. Requests submitted through Featurebase
            are governed by Featurebase&apos;s privacy controls and policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have questions about your data or wish to make a
            privacy-related request, email me at {SUPPORT_EMAIL}.
          </p>

          <h2 id="changes">Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>
            I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be
            posted on this page with an updated &quot;Last updated&quot; date.
            Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the
            revised policy.
